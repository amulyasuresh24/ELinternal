Q1. Create a file with many IP's. Now take IP as an input from CLA, and see whether the IP is present in the IP file. Also print the count of the IP's matched. (here it is one after other) Extend the above problem, as IP's are stored in a horizontal manner as a single line. Apply the same task to it. (here it a line may have many ip's)

Q2.Hope the second problem the issue will be with a field with date datatype.in MySQL default date type is: yyyy-mm-dd in python to match this variable, it needs to change the format(if required), using format function.
